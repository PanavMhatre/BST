# BST

Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure in java which has two numbers. The lower number on the left and the bigger number on the right of the parent. A better explanation here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/. But this is my own replication of this with my own code and has some cool things I want to have BST have. Check it out!
